# FEP+ input and results for Eg5 alternative loop dataset

This protein structure was initially used to run the FEP calculations and yielded large outliers for ligands containing a phenol. The loop adjacent to the phenol was remodelled using the Schr√∂dinger loop refinement protocol. This structure was then used in the final Eg5 dataset.

This folder contains:

-    protein structure prepared with Maestro Protein Preparation Wizard.
-    ligands.sdf: 3D conformations of the ligands in the binding site. Prepared with LigPrep.
 -   results_5ns.csv: FEP+ results with sampling time of 5ns.
 -   results_20ns.csv: FEP+ results with sampling time of 20ns.
